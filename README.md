# Description

This 1 day What They Forgot (WTF) To Teach You About R workshop is for experienced R and RStudio users who want to better understand R execution via debugging and personal R administration. At the conclusion of the workshop you will have distinct strategies for debugging your own code versus someone else's code, as well as strategies for maintaining your R installation through the lens of reproducibility.

# Audience

This course is for you if you:

-   Have you been using R for a while and you want a deeper understanding of what code is executing when and where it is coming from.

-   Want strategies for overcoming roadblocks when when all else has failed in function execution or package installation.

-   Are willing to get into the weeds of your R installation, project organization, error messages, and source code.


## Prework

ADD INFORMATION YOU WANT LEARNERS TO HAVE / STEPS THEY WANT THEM TO
COMPLETE PRIOR TO THE WORKSHOP. THIS COULD BE A LINK TO A THREAD ON
RSTUDIO COMMUNITY, PACKAGE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS, HOW TO GET AN
RSTUDIO.CLOUD ACCOUNT, ETC.
